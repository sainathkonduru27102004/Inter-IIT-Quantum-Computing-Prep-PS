## PS: Traffic Congestion Management During Urban Events
The problem of managing traffic congestion dynamically during major urban events is complex
because such events often cause unexpected and significant disruptions to normal traffic flow. A
hybrid traffic management system, which combines classical algorithms and quantum
algorithms, offers an advanced solution by tackling different parts of the problem with the
best-suited techniques.

### Understanding the Problem:
During major urban events (like concerts, sports games, or festivals), large numbers of vehicles
head toward the same areas, often overwhelming existing traffic systems. Traditional traffic
control methods may not be flexible or fast enough to handle such surges, leading to severe
congestion, delayed emergency responses, and general traffic chaos.
To manage this complexity, we need a dynamic traffic management system that can:
1. Optimize vehicle routing from different parts of the city.
2. Adjust traffic signals in real-time based on current congestion levels.
3. Reroute traffic dynamically as new congestion points develop.
4. Ensure priority paths for emergency vehicles when needed.
   
### Method Used 
The method we propose combines classical optimization techniques with quantum computing to
handle traffic management tasks during major urban events. The classical approach is used
for the initial traffic flow analysis, while the quantum approach is employed for more complex,
dynamic tasks that involve real-time traffic control. By using both, we can optimize the system
far beyond what classical methods alone can achieve. The key quantum algorithm chosen is the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), supported by Quantum Annealing
and Quantum Simulators to simulate the traffic system and optimize high-complexity
scenarios.

#### Classical Method:
##### Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path Routing:
Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known classical method for calculating the
shortest or least congested path between two points in a road network.
It treats the city’s road network like a graph, where each intersection is a
node and each road between intersections is an edge. Each road is assigned a “weight”
that represents its travel time or distance. Dijkstra's algorithm then calculates the
quickest path from a starting point to a destination by comparing all possible routes and
selecting the one with the smallest total weight.
This algorithm provides an efficient way to estimate how traffic will be
distributed across the city. By calculating the shortest paths for vehicles, we can balance
the load across the network and prevent congestion from building up in certain areas.

#### Quantum Method:
To improve traffic management and handle more complex tasks, we introduce several quantum
computing techniques. These allow us to manage real-time, high-complexity situations faster
and more efficiently than classical methods alone.

##### Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA):
QAOA is a quantum algorithm used for solving optimization problems,
particularly useful for minimizing traffic congestion by optimizing traffic signal timings and
rerouting strategies.Intersections with traffic signals are represented as nodes in a graph.
QAOA finds the best timing for each traffic signal to reduce congestion. It does this by
continuously optimizing the settings based on real-time traffic data.Traffic conditions during urban events can change quickly, and fixed
signal timings aren’t effective in managing sudden surges of vehicles. QAOA
dynamically adjusts traffic signals in real-time, ensuring smoother traffic flow and
reduced congestion at intersections.

##### Quantum Annealing:
Quantum annealing is another quantum technique, ideal for solving
high-dimensional optimization problems, like determining the best routes for vehicles
when roads become congested.Quantum annealing explores a large number of possible solutions to
complex routing problems. It quickly finds the optimal route for vehicles, even in
congested areas, and can prioritize emergency vehicles by providing them with faster,
less congested paths.Quantum annealing allows us to dynamically reroute vehicles in
real-time, especially during moments of high congestion. It also ensures that emergency
vehicles can get through heavy traffic without delays.

##### Quantum Simulation for Traffic Modeling:
Quantum simulations use quantum computers to model and predict the
impact of different traffic configurations, helping us plan for sudden changes in traffic
volume during urban events.Quantum simulators can process and analyze complex scenarios, such
as how a sudden increase in vehicles will affect congestion. By modeling these
situations in advance, we can predict where problems might occur and take action
before they happen.Traffic during urban events can be unpredictable. By using quantum
simulations, we can test various traffic control strategies (like signal timings and
rerouting plans) and see how they will impact the actual traffic flow, helping us choose
the best strategy.

##### Why this Hybrid Approach?
By combining classical and quantum methods, this hybrid system enables us to handle both
regular and complex traffic situations. Classical algorithms (like Dijkstra’s) provide a solid,
efficient foundation for traffic management, while quantum algorithms (QAOA, Quantum
Annealing, and Quantum Simulations) handle the more complicated, dynamic problems that
arise in real-time, ensuring smoother and faster traffic flow during urban events. This hybrid
approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of the system.
